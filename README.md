.NET Core MVC Application Integrated with Angular BOILER

This is a boilerplate for .NET MVC Applications integrated with an Angular frontend. 

This also includes the latest Bootstrap 4 version integrated with Angular; 
however there are known issues with regarding Bootstrap (jQuery) and Angular being utilized together (see issues).

I decided to make this repo public for those who'd like to start a .NET MVC Application 
with an Angular (7) frontend integrated into it.

This is still a work in progress that I will continue to update.
